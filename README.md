# LoRSim

A simulator for Riot Games's Legends of Runeterra in Unity, with game logic written in C#. Board state is just displayed as text for now.
The current version contains a limited set of unit cards with no effects (e.g. Loyal Badgerbear, The Empyrean, Academy Prodigy) as well as a primitive AI.
Simple spells and other effects are next, as well as improvements to the AI and UI.
